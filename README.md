## Name
Team_04

## Description
In this project, our team aims to create two versions of the game Hex.
In the first phase of this project, we built the version of the game Hex in which two human players can play against each other.
In the second phase of the project our team will develop a version of Hex in which a human can play against the computer.
For this, we will create an AI agent capable of playing Hex. We will research on which AI agent is more efficient to play the game.
We will also research on which AI agent performs best on which board size of the game Hex.
